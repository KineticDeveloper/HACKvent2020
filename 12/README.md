## Introduction

During their yearly season opening party our super-smart elves developed an improved usage of the well known RSA crypto algorithm. Under the "Green IT" initiative they decided to save computing horsepower (or rather reindeer power?) on their side. To achieve this they chose a pretty large private exponent, around 1/4 of the length of the modulus - impossible to guess. The reduction of 75% should save a lot of computing effort while still being safe. Shouldn't it?

Your SIGINT team captured some communication containing key exchange and encrypted data. [capture.pcap](capture.pcap)

Can you recover the original message?

Hint:

- Don't waste time with the attempt to brute-force the private key


## Analysis

I opened the file in Wireshark... but decoding and understanding SSL encryption packets and a custom encryption is over the top of my level of expertise.

So I will pass on this challenge.
